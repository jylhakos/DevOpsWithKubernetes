# Frontend

### Frontend to connect to backend

By default the expected path to backend is /api. This is where the application will send requests. 
To manually configure api path run with `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment value set, for example `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://example.com npm run build`
