# Model training for machine learning

The Python script downloads images to the `./imgs` folder and generates CSV files containing the image URIs in the `./data` folder. It then creates a model in the `./model` folder before exiting with a success code of 0.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) model is constructed using a machine-learning algorithm from the Keras and TensorFlow libraries, leveraging training data.
